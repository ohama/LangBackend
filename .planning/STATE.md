## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: F# implementation using P/Invoke to MLIR-C API
- [Roadmap]: Custom MLIR Dialect approach for FunLang-specific operations
- [Roadmap]: Incremental tutorial structure with working compiler at each chapter
- [Roadmap]: Boehm GC for memory management (integrated in Phase 2 before closures)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 - Foundation & Interop:**
- MLIR C API completeness for custom dialects is unverified; may need C++ wrapper if API gaps discovered during Phase 1 planning/execution
